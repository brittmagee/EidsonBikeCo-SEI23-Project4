#### This React-Django Application is the beginning stages of a fully functional eCommerce website for Edison Bike Shop. Users will also be able to view, add, and remove items from the shopping cart. Users will also be able to view the bike specs, preview Edison's social media, read testimonials, and learn statistics about the benefits of using an electric bicycle.
